# Data for Martin Andersens master's thesis

Yes, I know; don't track intermediary and/or generated data.
But no rule without exceptions; and some of the steps towards getting these data files are rather time and compute intensive.

## Files

**dtms_**: document term matrices
**json_**: json data files from LDAvis
**models_**: a data frame comparing various values of `K` for an LDA_Gibbs model. Contains 4 comparisons, as well as the model for each K.
**speeches_raw**: Raw speech transcripts from the Danish parliament, as generated by [Malte Lau](https://gitlab.com/maltelau/folketinget)
**speeches_annotated**: Speech data annotated and Part-of-Speech tagged by UDpipe
**speeches_metadata**: Just metadata, without the rather impressive amount of text
**tfidf_**: generated term frequency/inverse document frequency ratio for my corpora
**tokens_**: generated tokens
