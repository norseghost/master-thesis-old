* introduction is somewhat weak
	* mention tracking earlier?
	* how many speeches, exactly?
	* try and avoid orphan lines -either expand or contract
* add colon to last paragraph


* fix reference in ch 2.1

fix reference ch 3

review ch 7.1
expand 7.2 - tensions

ch 8 intro- double 'eller'
political game metaphor end ch 8 - invoke Bourdieau and struggles for position in field?

expand text-as-data

ch 8?9 add a description  of corpora peculiarties?

9.1 tweaked algoritm for data preprocessing
* (reduced sparsity filter to .9999, or 0.1 per mille)
* tweaked cutoff point for text filtering to median of *unique* tfidf rather than *all* - many common phrasings means many low-scoring words
* structure of text necessitates use of stopwords for analysis - many repeated phrasings from document headers and the like (the data extractor script needs tweaking, too)

ch 10 - unigrams v bigrams - bigrams more useful?
headers?

data exploration  â€” add LDAvis outputs to blog, for reference?
