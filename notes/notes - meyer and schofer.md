# Schofer & Meyer - The world Wide Expansion of Higher Education

1900 --> 2000: 200x growth in worldwide enrollment in tertiary education
               500K --> 100 million; 1% --> 20% of cohort
Virtues arre taken for granted, researchers decry limited espansion instead of questioning *why* expansion
A worldwide phenomenon; Tertiary education outpaced mass education 1950-70
Reflects a new model of society
	--> democratization, human rights, scientization, development planning
	--> hyper-expansion of higher ed

## Explanations of national variance

- Functionalism; economic development drives expansion
- conflict/competition:
	> education provides social status
	> hyperinflation of higher ed as result of competition
	> less functional
	> H2: higher ed responds more rapidly under conditions of high ethiic group competition
	> BUT: some argue that high status groups constrain expansion to maintain their positions
- decentralization --> faster expansion
- centralization --> maybe? slower expansion

## Institutionalization - global factors

Expansion outruns independent variables, and occurs accross varied societies
Concentrated in a particular time period
1930-1960:
	> Too many higher educated members of society is counterproductive for both individual and state
	> "over-education", what is the need for college education?

1960 -->
	> from a "static" labor market/society to a human capital centric model of socioeconomic expansion
	> progress vs ineficciency and anomie
	> historical roots: progressive regimes won wars

New model of society:

- Democratization, human rights
	> individual equality, empowerment
	> absence of demographics legitimized as a social problem
- Scientization
	> more areas brought under the auspices of science, particularly the social world
	> higher apparent utility of higher ed
- natural development 
	> global institutionalization of doctrines of national develoopment
	> human capital/manpower plannig
	  > increased productivity through education
	> shift from centralized to decentralized development planning
- orgs/institutions spread pro-ed discourse
	> UNESCO et al; intensifies the influence of global discourse on nations

## Institutional theory: National factors

> "Modern diffusion of highly rationalized models of education and society"

Not all nations especially likely to conform to models
	> H5: Higher ed expands more rapidly in contries linked in organization and identity to world models

## Expansion of secondary education
enmeshed in expansion of tertiary education, correlated, not causal
reflects status competition, credential inflation
	> H7: More secondary --> more rapid rise in tertiary

## data and methods

- generalized least-squared regression

dep var: higher ed enrollment per 1000 capita
data: unesco, banks

global independent vars:
- democratization
- development planning
- scientization
- polity structure

national independent vars:
- world polity linkage
- secondary enrollment
- economic development
- ethnic fractionalization
- democracy
- state control
- prior communism
(plus two i couldn't read)

## Results
Dramatic different countries, similar growth curves
converging enrollment by region
more women than men enrolled
ethno linguistic factionalism negatively impacts expansion
	> limits in place by the dominant groups
negative correction to confomity
national democracy insignificant; global democracy important
State control inhibits growth (somewhat)
Very rapid expansion in former iron curtain states
neo institutional variables much more important after 1960
p18: doubts on the "knowledge society"
female expansion not excessively high; correlates to general trends of increased access to underserved groups
